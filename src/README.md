# NVIDIA BioNeMo Blueprint for Protein Binder Design in Drug Discovery

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook showing a complete example. Check out the
[notebook](./protein-binder-design.ipynb) itself for more explanation of
how the protein binder design pipeline works.

Assuming you have already deployed the NIMs using the provided docker compose yaml found in [deploy](../deploy), you should be able to start up a Jupyter notebook instance and get going immediately!

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
